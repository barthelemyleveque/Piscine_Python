# Piscine_Python
Beta tester for a one week bootcamp, covering python basics, numpy and pandas.

Working with the student' association 42AI, we had to highlight issues and propose ways to improve the exercises. We did it through the GitHub issues system.

The topics that were covered each day :
* Day00 : Basic stuff (variables, types, functions...)
* Day01 : Object-oriented programming
* Day02 : Decorators, multiprocessing
* Day03 : NumPy
* Day04 : Pandas
